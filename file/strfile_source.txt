file. It has a current <i>position</i> within its file which can
be both {@link #position() <i>queried</i>} and {@link #position(long)
<i>modified</i>}.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
of bytes that can be read and written and whose current {@link #size
<i>size</i>} can be queried.  The size of the file increases
when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
decreases when it is {@link #truncate <i>truncated</i>}.  The
file may also have some associated <i>metadata</i> such as access
permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
define methods for metadata access.
